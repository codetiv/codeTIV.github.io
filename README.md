Hi all! I am a Electrical/Electronic Technician, Husband, Father, and various pet owner. I've been
learning different programming languages from Python, Javascript, Vue, dabbled in C#, learning control flows and
many other technology. Even dipping in Cybersecurity. So, I decided I want to pursue full stack development as a
instead of a hobby.
